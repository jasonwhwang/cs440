UIUC CS440 Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains code for the CS440 AI course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Chanpaign.

MP1: Search
This project is focused on building general-purpose search algorithmns to control a
"Pacman-like" agent that needs to find a path through a maze to find the exit while
collecting tokens.

MP2: Planning, Games
Part 1 is for solving a constraint satisfaction problem, pentomino tilings.
Part 2 is for solving implementing ultimate tic-tac-toe with minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.

MP3: Naive Bayes & Perceptron Classification
Part 1: Fashion Image Classification
Given a set of images of cloes, train a naive bayes model and a perceptron model to predict the correct class label given an unseen image.
Part 2: Text Classification
Given a text dataset, train a naive bayes unigram model (bag of words) to predict the right class label given an unseen text.
